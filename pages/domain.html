            <div class="domain-category">
                <h3>Literature Survey</h3>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The integration of virtual learning environments (VLEs) and personalized learning has shown significant potential in enhancing IT education. 
                    Research highlights the importance of adapting educational platforms to students' learning styles, improving both engagement and academic performance 
                    through models such as VARK and Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory. Studies also emphasize the effectiveness of collaborative learning tools, like virtual 
                    study groups, which foster deeper understanding and peer-to-peer interaction in IT subjects that demand both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. 
                    Furthermore, the application of algorithm-driven academic recommendations offers a more refined approach, guiding students toward fields such as Software Engineering
                     or Data Science based on their performance in critical modules, rather than relying solely on GPA</p>

            <!-- Research Gap -->
            <div class="domain-category">
                <h3>Research Gap</h3>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">While current educational technologies have made strides in integrating virtual learning
                    environments (VLEs) and personalized learning, significant gaps remain in tailoring these systems specifically to the diverse needs of IT students. 
                    Most platforms focus on general academic performance metrics, such as GPA, which fail to capture the nuanced strengths of students in key technical modules.
                     Moreover, existing collaborative learning tools often overlook the importance of grouping students based on complementary learning styles, which could enhance 
                     peer-to-peer interaction and problem-solving. Additionally, the use of algorithm-driven recommendations for field specialization remains underexplored, with 
                     limited research on how these systems can be optimized to provide more personalized academic guidance. Addressing these gaps could significantly improve the 
                     effectiveness of educational platforms, offering more tailored and impactful learning experiences for IT students.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Research Problem -->
            <div class="domain-category">
                <h3>Research Problem</h3>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"> Current educational platforms in IT struggle to offer personalized guidance that truly reflects a student’s unique strengths in key technical subjects. 
                    By focusing primarily on GPA, these systems miss the deeper insights that could guide students toward fields like Software Engineering or Data Science. 
                    Additionally, virtual group study tools often ignore individual learning styles, limiting the potential for effective collaboration. The lack of an intelligent, 
                    algorithm-driven system that tailors academic recommendations based on specific module performance creates a gap, leaving students without the personalized support 
                    they need to make informed academic and career decisions.</p>

            <!-- Methodology -->
            <div class="domain-category">
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"> This research combines advanced technologies and educational strategies to build a personalized virtual platform that enhances both collaborative learning
                     and academic guidance. A comprehensive, three-dimensional learning styles assessment is used to gather data on students' sensory, cognitive, and technical
                      preferences. Using machine learning algorithms, students are dynamically grouped into virtual study teams, optimizing collaboration by aligning complementary 
                      learning styles. <br>
                    For academic guidance, a decision-tree algorithm analyzes students' performance in critical modules to recommend specialized fields such as Software 
                    Engineering or Data Science. The algorithm evaluates module-specific grades, providing personalized feedback and suggestions for improvement. 
                    The platform was validated using historical academic data to ensure its accuracy in predicting successful field outcomes. Through this dual approach, 
                    the system fosters both immediate academic support and long-term career alignment.</p>
